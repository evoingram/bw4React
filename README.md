## Build Week Project

Live @ https://devdeskelireact.now.sh/

This is my old React I build week project, which previously only had a local back end, but since I did the back end for this same project, i decided to hook it up instead of keeping the localhost links on it!

Still work in progress; haven't done update/put stuff yet.  But everything else works great.
