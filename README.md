## Build Week Project

Live @ https://devdeskelireact.now.sh/

This is my old React I build week project, which previously only had a local back end, but since I did the back end for this same project, i decided to hook it up instead of keeping the localhost links on it!

Still work in progress; haven't done update/put stuff yet.  But everything else works great.  Helpers can see their assigned tickets as well as the queue, and students can create tickets and view tickets they've created.  Helpers who are also students can see both.  You can view your profile but not edit it yet.
